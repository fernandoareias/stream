# Kafka Streaming Project

This project leverages Docker Compose to spin up a set of Kafka Streams applications that interact with Apache Kafka clusters. Each service is designed to handle specific events, such as "Proposta Criada", "Cart√£o Criado", and "Client Created". The architecture is highly modular, allowing you to scale and extend individual components as necessary.

## Overview

This project sets up multiple services that read from and produce to Kafka topics in real-time. It enables streaming data processing for various events. The components are integrated with Apache Kafka and the Confluent Schema Registry, ensuring data consistency across streams.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Kafka Brokers:** A set of Kafka brokers that manage the streaming data.
- **Schema Registry:** Provides a centralized service to store and manage schema versions for Kafka data.
- **Kafka Streams Apps:** Each app subscribes to specific Kafka topics and processes data in real-time.

Services run in a Docker network, enabling seamless communication between components.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker (version 3.9 or higher)
- Docker Compose

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder> 
```


# Build and start the services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

# Verify the running services
```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the services streaming-proposta-criada-app, streaming-cartao-criado-app, client-created-app, and others up and running.

## Services

### 1. **streaming-proposta-criada-app**
- **Description:** Consumes and processes events related to proposals being created.
- **Kafka Topics:** proposta-criada
- **Dependencies:** Kafka brokers (`kafka1`, `kafka2`, `kafka3`)

### 2. **streaming-cartao-criado-app**
- **Description:** Consumes and processes events related to the creation of credit cards.
- **Kafka Topics:** cartao-criado
- **Dependencies:** Kafka brokers (`kafka1`, `kafka2`, `kafka3`)

### 3. **client-created-app**
- **Description:** Consumes and processes events related to client creation.
- **Kafka Topics:** client-created
- **Dependencies:** Kafka brokers (`kafka1`, `kafka2`, `kafka3`)

### 4. **client-by-product-app**
- **Description:** Processes events related to clients filtered by their associated products.
- **Kafka Topics:** client-by-product
- **Dependencies:** Kafka brokers (`kafka1`, `kafka2`, `kafka3`)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- **KAFKA_BROKER:** The list of Kafka broker addresses (e.g., `host.docker.internal:19090`, `host.docker.internal:19091`, `host.docker.internal:19092`).
- **SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL:** The URL of the schema registry (e.g., `http://host.docker.internal:8081`).
- **JOB_NAME:** The job name used for each Kafka Streams application (e.g., `streaming-proposta-criada-event`).

### Kafka Cluster

This project assumes that you are running a Kafka cluster with three brokers (`kafka1`, `kafka2`, `kafka3`) and a schema registry running at `http://host.docker.internal:8081`.
